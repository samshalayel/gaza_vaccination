## Existing Data Structure (location_point_unified_corrected_1.js)

**Format:** GeoJSON FeatureCollection
- Total Features: 107 medical points
- Structure:
  - Medical Point Name (English & Arabic)
  - Teams Organization
  - Aggregated vaccination counts
  - Geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude)

**Properties in Existing Data:**
- Medical Point - Health Facility Name in English
- Medical Point - Health Facility Name in Arabic
- Teams Organization
- Aggregated_all_child
- Aggregated_Vaccination status of a Child | On Schedule
- Aggregated_Total Children Vaccinated by Age | above 24
- Aggregated_Total Children Vaccinated by Age | 0 to 12

## Conversion Process

### Data Aggregation
The conversion script performs the following:

1. **Reads Excel File:** Loads all 588 vaccination records
2. **Aggregates by Facility:** Multiple reports per facility are summed together
3. **Matches Coordinates:** Uses existing location data to get geographic coordinates
4. **Creates GeoJSON:** Converts to JavaScript GeoJSON format

### Aggregation Logic
For each health facility, the script aggregates:
- Total children across all reports
- Age group totals (0-12, 12-24, above 24 months)
- Vaccination status counts (Zero Dose, Defaulter, On Schedule)
- Individual vaccine counts (all 23 vaccine types)
- MUAC screening results
- Number of reports submitted

## Output File: vaccination_data.js

### Conversion Results

**Statistics:**
- Total Unique Facilities: 125
- Facilities with Coordinates: 121 (96.8%)
- Facilities without Coordinates: 4 (3.2%)
- Total Features in GeoJSON: 121
- Output File Size: 6,182 lines

**Facilities Without Coordinates:**
These 4 facilities were in the Excel but not in the existing location database:
1. Kh/Younis Prep. Boys "A" horaney
2. MSF Spain's Al Attar PHCC
3. Mobile Team - UNRWA
4. Mobile Vehicle

## Comparison: Old vs New Format

### Similarities
- Both use GeoJSON FeatureCollection format
- Both include facility names and coordinates
- Both track vaccination counts by age group
- Both have aggregated statistics

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Old Format (location_point) | New Format (vaccination_data) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Facility Name** | English & Arabic names | English name only |
| **Organization** | Teams Organization field | Included in Governorate |
| **Data Granularity** | Basic aggregates | Detailed vaccine breakdown |
| **Vaccine Details** | Not included | 23 individual vaccine types |
| **MUAC Screening** | Not included | 4 malnutrition indicators |
| **Report Tracking** | Single snapshot | Multiple reports aggregated |
| **Time Period** | Static | Recent reports (Jan 2026) |
| **Data Source** | Historical baseline | Current survey data |

### Enhanced Fields in New Format
1. **Detailed Vaccine Breakdown:** 23 individual vaccine counts
2. **MUAC Screening:** Malnutrition assessment data
3. **Report Metadata:** Number of reports per facility
4. **Vaccination Status:** Zero Dose, Defaulter, On Schedule
5. **Governorate Information:** Regional classification

## Usage Recommendations

### 1. Replace Existing Data
If you want to show the latest vaccination data:
- Update your HTML to reference `vaccination_data.js` instead of `location_point_unified_corrected_1.js`
- Update variable name from `json_location_point_unified_corrected_1` to `json_vaccination_data`

### 2. Show Both Datasets
For comparison purposes:
- Keep both files
- Create separate layers in your map
- Allow users to toggle between baseline and current data

### 3. Merge Datasets
Combine historical and current data:
- Use facility name as key
- Show trends over time
- Calculate changes in vaccination rates

## Sample Feature Data

   - Ready to use in web mapping applications

2. **analyze_excel.py**
   - Python script to analyze Excel structure
   - Displays headers and sample data

3. **convert_to_js.py**
   - Python script to convert Excel to JavaScript

   - Useful for reference

5. **CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md** (this file)
   - Complete documentation of the conversion process

## Next Steps

To integrate the new data into your web application:

1. Include the new JavaScript file in your HTML:
   ```html
   <script src="data/vaccination_data.js"></script>
   ```

2. Update your map layer configuration to use `json_vaccination_data`

3. Consider updating popup templates to show the new detailed vaccine information

4. Update legends and filters to reflect the new data structure

## Technical Notes

- **Coordinate Matching:** The script matched 121 out of 125 facilities (96.8% success rate)
- **Data Quality:** All numeric fields were validated and converted to integers
- **Aggregation Method:** Sum of all reports per facility
- **Date Handling:** Report dates preserved but aggregated data represents totals
- **Character Encoding:** UTF-8 encoding used to preserve Arabic text in properties
